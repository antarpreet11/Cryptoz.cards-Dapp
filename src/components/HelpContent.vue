                    The <router-link to="/shop"> Shop </router-link> will show
                    you the current total number of Zoombies types available at
                    the current time. We will continue to load new sets
                    containing approx 10-20 cards every month until we reach the
                    hard limit of a total of 5000 types. The Zoombies contracts
                    do not allow anyone to edit or overwrite a card types
                    definition once they have been loaded.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    New types released to the Shop will appear immediately. New
                    types loaded in the boosters, will only be indicated by a
                    type count increase, but are available to be randonly minted
                    immediately.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Shop card release countdown</h3>
                  <p>
                    When new types are released to the Shop, the minting button
                    will display a countdown timer to the moment the card will
                    be unlocked for minting. Please note the timer you see on
                    the screen may be off by a few seconds due to differences in
                    your device load and memory. We advise that you browse away
                    and back to the Shop about 10 seconds before they release to
                    re-sync your browser timing. The actual moment a card type
                    is released for minting is determined by the smart contract,
                    this website is giving you the best approximation of that
                    moment.
